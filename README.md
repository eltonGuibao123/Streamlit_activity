Problem2. I already have a file containing data in our data analytics subject. That file I used contains lot of data.  I load it in the code using this line  df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\sir paulin\cleaned_synthetic.csv").  after I load the data using pandas, I show the data using data frame, and then I add features that select the column to filter and value form filter. Also I add feature to select only raw data alone to read.
